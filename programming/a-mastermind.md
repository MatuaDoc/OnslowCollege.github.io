# Task 1: Password Checker

Create a program that allows one user to specify a password, then allows another user to guess the password.

## 1.1 Requirements

1. The program must ask the user for a password. The password must conform to the following criteria:
    1. It may only be four characters in length
    2. It may only contain the characters ``1``, ``2``, ``3``, or ``4``
2. Clear the screen by printing 100 blank links so that the second user can't see the password
3. The program then asks another user to guess the password
4. The user has up to 10 guesses
5. For each guess, print out the digit, replacing each digit with the following:
    1. For each correct guess, print 游릭
    2. For each wrong guess, print 游린
6. At the end of the game, print out the correct and incorrect guess lines.
7. If the user guesses correctly within 10 guesses, congratulate them for guessing correctly
    - If the user does **not** guess correctly, reveal the password

## 1.2 Hint

Strings can be treated the same as lists:
- They can be accessed with a subscript
- You can use a for loop on a string
  - Each character in the string is the individual list item

## 1.3 Example output

### Player 1 sets a password

```
Welcome to Password Checker!
Player 1 will enter a 4-digit password containing 1, 2, 3, or 4.
Player 2 will guess the password.

Player 1, enter a password: abcd
Sorry, the password must only contain 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Player 1, enter a password: 1239
Sorry, the password must only contain 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Player 1, enter a password: 1234
```

After this, print 100 empty lines.

### Player 2 guesses the password

```
Player 2, guess the password: 1323
游릭 游린 游린 游린

Player 2, guess the password: 1432
游릭 游린 游릭 游린

Player 2, guess the password: 1234
游릭 游릭 游릭 游릭

游릭 游린 游린 游린
游릭 游린 游릭 游린
游릭 游릭 游릭 游릭

Congratulations! You guessed the password.
```

The password was: 1234
```

# Task 2: Extension

## 2.1 Requirements

Improve the game with the following features:

1. Allow the password to contain all digits (0 to 9)
2. Instead of asking for a password, generate a random one
3. If a user guesses a correct digit but it is in the wrong location, print 游댰
4. When printing the guess lines at the end, also tell the user how many guesses they made.

## 2.2 Example output

If the password is ``1234``:

```
Player 2, guess the password: 1337
游릭 游댰 游릭 游린

Player 2, guess the password: 1733
游릭 游린 游릭 游댰

Player 2, guess the password: 1234
游릭 游릭 游릭 游릭

游릭 游댰 游릭 游린
游릭 游린 游릭 游댰
游릭 游릭 游릭 游릭

Congratulations! You guessed the password in 3 guesses.
