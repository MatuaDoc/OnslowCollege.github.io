    ```

## 3.3 Set up Visual Studio Code

To edit your Python code, you will use Visual Studio Code. This is an integrated development environment that makes it easy to manage your Python files, test code, and get helpful suggestions when you're editing code.

## 3.4 Install Visual Studio Code

- Copy and paste the following commands and press Enter after each:

## 3.5 Set up Settings Sync in Visual Studio Code

- Click on the ![Accounts](/img/account.svg) Accounts tab
- Click "Turn on Settings Sync"

- Click to sign in with your Microsoft account
  - Use your school email address and password to log in

If you use Visual Studio Code on a different computer, you will be able to repeat this process on it to use the same settings for all your computers.
