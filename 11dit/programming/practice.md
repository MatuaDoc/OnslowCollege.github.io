# Explanation from the standard

## AS91883

| Achievement | Achievement with Merit | Achievement with Excellence |
| :-- | :-: | --: |
| Develop a computer program | Develop an informed computer program | Develop a refined computer program |

A computer program:

- uses variables storing at least two types of data (e.g. numeric, text, Boolean)
- uses sequence, selection and iteration control structures
- uses input from a user, sensors or another external source

It also uses one or more of:

- data stored in collections (e.g. lists, arrays, dictionaries)
- user-defined methods, functions or procedures

Example of ways of making a program **flexible and robust** include:

- using methods, functions, procedures, actions, conditions and control structures effectively
- checking input data for validity
- correctly handling expected, boundary and invalid values
- using constants, variables and derived values in place of literals

# Time allowance

All work must be done your own.

There will be regular submission check-ins to track your progress.
Your final submission is at the end of your last lesson on the school week ending Term 1.

There will be **NO** extensions.

# Task

Maia has been given a collection of jeans and shoes. 

- Jeans
  - 2x pairs of size 26
  - 4x pairs of size 28
  - 1x pair of size 30
  - 2x pairs of size 32
  - 2x pairs of size 34
- Shoes
  - 1x pair of size 7
  - 2x pairs of size 8
  - 3x pairs of size 9
  - 2x pairs of size 10
  - 1x pair of size 11
  - 1x pair of size 12
  - 2x pair of size 13

Maia shares the clothes with her friends.

- The smallest size of jeans Maia can wear is 26 and the largest is 28. She can only fit size 8 shoes
- The smallest size of jeans Trent can wear is 30 and the largest is 32. He can only fit size 13 shoes
- The smallest size of jeans Bill can wear is 28 and the largest is 30. They can only fit size 10 shoes

## Requirements

Create a program for Maia that:

1. asks the user for *Jeans*, *Shoes* or *All*
2. if the user selects *Jeans* or *Shoes*, the program will ask for a size and tell Maia how many jeans or shoes she has in that size
3. if the user selects *All*, it will show:
    - how many items of clothing Maia owns
    - how many jeans and shoes she is able to fit
    - and the number of combinations of jeans and shoes that her friends can wear

## Expected output

# Assessment Requirements

## Achieved

For Achieved, you must:

- store data in at least two types (text, number, boolean, etc.)
- use conditional statements and/or loops
- get input from the user
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with expected cases

You must also:

- contain data in **at least TWO** lists, **OR**
- define and use **at least TWO** functions

You may use both lists and functions, but you must use **at least TWO** of one, the other, or both.

## Achieved with Merit

For Achieved with Merit, you must:

- follow conventions from the programming language
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with both expected cases and relevant boundary cases

## Achieved with Excellence

For Achieved with Excellence, you must:

- ensure that your program is flexible and robust
  - it should reduce repeated code througout your program
  - it should use constants appropriately
  - it must behave in an expected manner
  - it must not crash
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with expected and boundary cases, and correctly handles invalid cases

# Restrictions

You must:
- use a suitable, text-based programming language
  - You will be expected to use Python unless you have consulted with your teacher

You may:
- consult this website's notes
- consult your previous work

However, you may **not**:
- copy other students' work, even with modifications
- copy code online without proper attribution
- ask other students to fix errors for you
- present any content as your own work

# Submission

- Your work will be submitted through Microsoft Teams
