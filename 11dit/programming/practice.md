# Explanation from the standard

## AS91883

| Achievement | Achievement with Merit | Achievement with Excellence |
| :-- | :-: | --: |
| Develop a computer program | Develop an informed computer program | Develop a refined computer program |

A computer program:

- uses variables storing at least two types of data (e.g. numeric, text, Boolean)
- uses sequence, selection and iteration control structures
- uses input from a user, sensors or another external source

It also uses one or more of:

- data stored in collections (e.g. lists, arrays, dictionaries)
- user-defined methods, functions or procedures

Example of ways of making a program **flexible and robust** include:

- using methods, functions, procedures, actions, conditions and control structures effectively
- checking input data for validity
- correctly handling expected, boundary and invalid values
- using constants, variables and derived values in place of literals

# Time allowance

All work must be done your own.

The practice assessment is due at the end of week 8.

You may submit earlier for feedback, then resubmit. You may do this at maximum **two times**.

There will be **NO** extensions.

# Task

Maia has been given a collection of jeans and shoes. 

- **Jeans**
  - 2x pairs of size 26
  - 4x pairs of size 28
  - 1x pair of size 30
  - 2x pairs of size 32
  - 2x pairs of size 34

- **Shoes**
  - 1x pair of size 7
  - 2x pairs of size 8
  - 3x pairs of size 9
  - 2x pairs of size 10
  - 1x pair of size 11
  - 1x pair of size 12
  - 2x pair of size 13

Maia shares the clothes with her friends.

- The smallest size of jeans Maia can wear is 26 and the largest is 28. She can only fit size 8 shoes
- The smallest size of jeans Trent can wear is 30 and the largest is 32. He can only fit size 13 shoes
- The smallest size of jeans Bill can wear is 28 and the largest is 30. They can only fit size 10 shoes

## Requirements

Create a program for Maia that:

1. asks the user for *Jeans*, *Shoes* or *All*
2. if the user selects *Jeans* or *Shoes*, the program will ask for a size and tell Maia how many jeans or shoes she has in that size
3. if the user selects *All*, it will show:
    - how many items of clothing Maia owns
    - how many jeans and shoes she is able to fit
    - and the number of combinations of jeans and shoes that her friends can wear

## Expected output

# Assessment Requirements

## Achieved

For Achieved, you must:

- store data in at least two types (text, number, boolean, etc.)
- use conditional statements and/or loops
- get input from the user
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with expected cases

You must also:

- contain data in **at least TWO** lists, **OR**
- define and use **at least TWO** functions

You may use both lists and functions, but you must use **at least TWO** of one, the other, or both.

## Achieved with Merit

For Achieved with Merit, you must:

- follow conventions from the programming language
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with both expected cases and relevant boundary cases

## Achieved with Excellence

For Achieved with Excellence, you must:

- ensure that your program is flexible and robust
  - it should reduce repeated code througout your program
  - it should use constants appropriately
  - it must behave in an expected manner
  - it must not crash
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with expected and boundary cases, and correctly handles invalid cases

# Restrictions

You must:
- use a suitable, text-based programming language
  - You will be expected to use Python unless you have consulted with your teacher

You may:
- consult this website's notes
- consult your previous work

However, you may **not**:
- copy other students' work, even with modifications
- copy code online without proper attribution
- ask other students to fix errors for you
- present any content as your own work

# Submission

- Your work will be submitted through Microsoft Teams
