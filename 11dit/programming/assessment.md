# Explanation from the standard

## AS91883

| Achievement | Achievement with Merit | Achievement with Excellence |
| :-- | :-: | --: |
| Develop a computer program | Develop an informed computer program | Develop a refined computer program |

A computer program:

- uses variables storing at least two types of data (e.g. numeric, text, Boolean)
- uses sequence, selection and iteration control structures
- uses input from a user, sensors or another external source

It also uses one or more of:

- data stored in collections (e.g. lists, arrays, dictionaries)
- user-defined methods, functions or procedures

Example of ways of making a program **flexible and robust** include:

- using methods, functions, procedures, actions, conditions and control structures effectively
- checking input data for validity
- correctly handling expected, boundary and invalid values
- using constants, variables and derived values in place of literals

# Time allowance

All work must be done your own.

There will be regular submission check-ins to track your progress.
Your final submission is at the end of your last lesson on the school week ending Term 1.

There will be **NO** extensions.

# Task

Create a general knowledge quiz about a school subject of your choosing.

This quiz will be used as a study aid. For example, it could help you to remember:

- the elements of the Periodic table
- your multiplication tables
- basic phrases in another language
- important dates for historical events

## Requirements

1. welcome the user to the quiz. Make the topic clear to the user
2. the quiz will have **at least** 10 questions (you may add as many as you like)
3. each question must have a correct answer â€” you may optionally add some incorrect answers for multi-choice questions (if you wish to have any)
4. when the player starts, they are asked all 10 questions
5. each question a correct answer
6. the user must be able to answer each question in some way
   - if you wish the user to type the answer:
      - you must give the user the point if they use the wrong case (upper, lower, etc.)
      - you do not need to give the user the point if they misspell it
   - if you wish the user to type a letter on number:
      - you must make it clear which letter/number matches which answer
7. when the quiz is finished, show the player their score
   1. give a big congratulations to the user on a perfect score
   2. give a small congratulations the player on a score between 7-9
   3. if a user scores 6 or fewer, tell them to try again
9.  ask the user if they would like to try again, and repeat the quiz if they wish

## Expected output

For this example, the quiz is only three questions long. Your quiz should be ten questions long.

```
Welcome to the Python Quiz!

QUESTION 1: What is the keyword used to define a function?
Type the correct answer: def
Correct! You have 1 point.

QUESTION 2: Type the punctuation mark is placed at the end of an if statement?
    1 - full stop (.)
    2 - exclamation mark (!)
    3 - colon (:)
    4 - semi-colon (;)
Type the correct number: d
You must choose a number from 1 to 4. Please try again.

Type the correct number: 4
Incorrect! The correct answer was 3 - colon (:)
You have 1 point.

QUESTION 3: Which function is used to check the length of a list? len or length?
Type the correct answer: len
Correct! You have 2 points.

You scored 2 out of 3! Well done!
Press y to play again: n

Thank you for playing.

# Assessment Requirements

## Achieved

For Achieved, you must:

- store data in at least two types (text, number, boolean, etc.)
- use conditional statements and/or loops
- get input from the user
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with expected cases

You must also:

- contain data in **at least TWO** lists, **OR**
- define and use **at least TWO** functions

You may use both lists and functions, but you must use **at least TWO** of one, the other, or both.

## Achieved with Merit

For Achieved with Merit, you must:

- follow conventions from the programming language
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with both expected cases and relevant boundary cases

## Achieved with Excellence

For Achieved with Excellence, you must:

- ensure that your program is flexible and robust
  - it should reduce repeated code througout your program
  - it should use constants appropriately
  - it must behave in an expected manner
  - it must not crash
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with expected and boundary cases, and correctly handles invalid cases

# Restrictions

You must:
- use a suitable, text-based programming language
  - You will be expected to use Python unless you have consulted with your teacher

You may:
- consult this website's notes
- consult your previous work

However, you may **not**:
- copy other students' work, even with modifications
