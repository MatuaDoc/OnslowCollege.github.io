# Learning objectives

## Develop a computer program
- writing code for a program that performs a specified task using a suitable
programming language
    - in this course, we will be teaching Python 3.10 and higher
- setting out the program code clearly
- documenting the program with comments
- documenting the program with variable names and comments that describe code
function and behaviour
- following conventions for the chosen programming language (PEP-8)
- comprehensively testing and debugging the program to ensure that it works on a sample of expected cases, relevant boundary cases, and handles invalid cases
- ensuring that the program is a well-structured, logical response to the task
- making the program flexible and robust

## Develop a design for a digital media outcome

- defining the purpose and end users for the digital outcome
- researching and generating a range of design ideas
- selecting a chosen design and describing the appropriateness of that chosen design
- using feedback to improve the design
- describing relevant implications and explaining how the design meets them
- justifying, with evidence, that the chosen design is suitable for the purpose and end users

## Develop a digital media outcome

- using appropriate tools, techniques, and design elements for the purpose and end users
- applying appropriate data integrity and testing procedures in the development of the outcome
- using information from testing procedures to improve the quality and functionality of the outcome
- describing and addressing relevant implications
- showing iterative improvement througout the design, development, and testing process
- applying design elements effectively
