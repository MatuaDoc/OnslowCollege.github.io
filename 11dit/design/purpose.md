# Purpose

When designing a technological outcome of any kind, not just in digital technologies but in other technology classes as well, you must identify the **purpose** of the outcome.

The main purposes of a website might include:

- providing information to people
- educating people on a subject
- entertaining people
- persuading people to take a particular viewpoint or do something
- to sell a product or idea
- to foster community by uniting people around a common interest or goal

Of course, some websites might have multiple purposes. For example, YouTube.com provides a lot of different kinds of videos — some are entertaining, some are informative, etc.

## Activity 1

Can you think of a website for each of these purposes?

| Purpose | Website #1 | Website #2 |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **to inform** | stuff.co.nz | |
| **to educate** | educationperfect.com | |
| **to entertain** | netflix.com | |
| **to pursuade** | greenpeace.org | |
| **to sell** | mightyape.co.nz | |
| **to foster community** | facebook.com | |

## Activity 2

Can you think of any websites that match the following combinations of purposes?

| Purpose #1 | Purpose #2 | Website |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| to inform | to educate | |
| to educate | to entertain | |
| to educate | to pursuade | |
| to pursuade | to sell | |

# End users

Of course, you must also identify **whom** will be informed, educated, entertained, etc. These are your end users.

End users include the following:

- website owners: people who own the website, who want to use it for a particular purpose
- target audience: people identified as most likely to use the website for a purpose or purposes
- other users who may also use the website

These identified end users can be both groups or individuals. For example, the Onslow College website is targeted at:

- parents, who want to know information about Onslow College before enrolling their child at the school
- prospective students, who want to learn about what the school has to offer before coming
- new students, who want to find out information that they might have missed during their induction at the school
- existing students who need to access some information

In terms of individuals, you might include:

- the principal, whose aim for the website is to inform and educate whānau, students, and the community about the school
- coaches, who post up-to-date sports information including times and venues for matches, scores, etc.

## Demographics

For groups of end users, you should also consider the demographic information. This includes things such as:

- age
- gender (including sexual identity)
- locale (nationality, region, etc.)
- interests

## Activity 3

Can you identify the **one** (1) end user group of the following websites? What demographics are likely to 

| Website | End user group | Age range | Gender(s) | Locale | Interests |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| [smiggle.co.nz](https://www.smiggle.co.nz) | School-aged children, teenagers | 6-18 | any gender, though mostly targeted at young girls | New Zealand | people who like stationery |
| [1news.co.nz](https://www.1news.co.nz) | |
| [metlink.org.nz](http://metlink.org.nz) | |
| [countdown.co.nz](https://www.countdown.co.nz) | |
| [apple.com](https://apple.com/nz) | |
| [barbie.com](https://shop.mattel.com/pages/barbie) | |

## Activity 4

Can you identify **three** (3) groups of end users for **one** (1) of the following websites, the likely demographic information for each group, and what purpose the website serves for each group?

- [youtube.com](https://youtube.com)
- [rnz.co.nz](https://www.rnz.co.nz)
- [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)

| Group # | End user group | Age range | Gender(s) | Locale | Interests | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 3 |

# Task

You must identify the **purpose(s)** of your project's website and its **end users**.

In your portfolio document, write or record a paragraph about the purpose(s) of your website and why you have selected these purposes as most relevant.

Further, identify your website's end users, including any relevant demographic information. You should also state which purpose(s) is/are most relevant to each group of/individual end user(s).
