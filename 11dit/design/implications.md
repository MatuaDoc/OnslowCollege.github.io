title: Relevant Implications
---

When discussing a technological outcome's implications, it means thinking about all the aspects that make an outcome suitable for the audience in various ways.

For example, a website isn't made just for the person who makes it ‚Äî it's made for a specific [purpose and end users](purpose.md). Therefore, we must consider questions such as:

- is the thing we create socially acceptable for its audience?
- will differently-abled people be able to use the website?
- will a novice understand how to navigate it?
- do we respect people's privacy and intellectual property?

# List of implications

The following bullet points contain the implications, taken directly from the achievement standard, with example questions to help you consider whether or not these are **relevant** to your outcome.

## Social

- How does this outcome fit into society?
- Does it meet any societal needs?
- How do people relate to the outcome?
- How does it relate to people?

## Cultural

- Is the outcome culturally appropriate?
- Does it meet the needs of a culture/cultures?
- Which cultures? Te ao Maori? Other cultures?
- Do the specifications contain any cultural biases? Have these been identified and negotiated with the stakeholder(s)?
- If you have identified cultural biases, have you addressed these?
- Does your content contain any cultural artefacts? Images, video, audio, text in another language

## Legal

- Does the outcome meet all necessary legal requirements?
- In what way does it meet legal requirements?
- Which legal requirements? Which laws?

## Ethical

- What ethical considerations are relevant to the outcome?
- Is the outcome designed in an ethical way?
- Does the outcome meet ethical standards?
	- For the stakeholders? End user expectations?
- Where the outcome might need to do or present something whose ethics are difficult to define, is this accounted for?
	- In the brief?
	- In the design?
	- Some user-facing way? i.e. disclaimer, notice, confirmation page
	- Only available to some subset of end users?

## Intellectual property (IP)

- Does the content of the outcome belong to the owner?
- To the developer?
- Have you received permission to use certain content?
- Does your outcome adequately acknowledge other peoples' IP?

## Privacy

- Does the outcome store or use any private data?
- Private to whom? Users? Company? Organisation?
- Does the outcome respect user privacy? How?
- Does it conform to the Privacy Act (if needed; see also Legal)?
- What mechanisms are in place to protect private data?

## Accessibility

- Can people with accessibility needs use the outcome?
- Are there specific features built for the needs of users with accessibility needs?
- What tools have you made use of in order to make the outcome accessible?

## Usability

- Is the outcome intuitive?
- Would a person seeing it for the first time be able to figure out how to use it?
- How have/will you test(ed) usability?
- What paradigms or methodologies for measuring usability have you used?

## Functionality

- How does the outcome work?
- Does the outcome's functionality match the brief/specifications?
- Is the functionality discoverable, intuitive (see also [Usability](#usability))?
- In what ways does the outcome match the specifications for functionality?

## Aesthetics

- Is the outcome visually appealing? For whom? Stakeholders? Target end users?
- Do the aesthetics conform to a desired specification?
- Does the outcome integrate aesthetically with existing outcomes?

## Sustainability and future proofing

- Is the outcome robust, usable in future or able to be repurposed?
- What provisions have been made for future reuse/repurposing?
- How long is the outcome expected to be used?
- What is the outcome's potential shelf life?
- What tools or technologies did you select to ensure the outcome is sustainable or future-proofed?

## End-user considerations

- Health and safety
- Is there any aspect of the outcome that could impact the health and/or safety of an end-user?
- What health and safety risks have you identified?
- How have you mitigated health and safety risks relating to this outcome?
- Does the outcome conform to the Health and Safety Act (if relevant; see also [Legal](#legal))?

# Determining which implications are relevant

Looking through the implications above, ask yourself the question in relation to the outcome you are building.

Do the answers to those questions relate to:

- the requirements outlined in [the Task](task.md)?
- the purpose and/or end users?

For the assessment, you must identify, describe, ensure your design meets, and ensure your outcome *addresses* the implications.

## Describing the implications

 To describe an implication, you should üü• cite an established definition, üî∂ link the implication to the requirements/purpose/end users, then üü¢ state how your design and outcome will address the implications.

 For example:

 - üü• **Definition**: One thing I need to think about when designing a website is accessibility. Accessibility means "is about inclusion ‚Äî making sure everyone, including disabled people and those using assistive technologies, can access online information and services" (https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/design-and-ux/accessibility/)
     - This section cites the definition from digital.govt.nz and provides a link to where the definition was found.
     - Make sure to cite the actual website or book where you find the definition, not simply a search page.
 - üî∂ **Link**: It is important to consider accessibility for my website because students at Onslow College may have specific accessibility needs (low vision, reading difficulties) but want to access the content on my website.
     - This section links the accessibility implication to an end user group, students at Onslow College.
 - üü¢ **Addressing**: I will try to make my website accessible by using clear and easy to read fonts at sizes that are comfortable for low-vision users. I will also use colours that are suitable so that the text can be easily read against the background colour.
     - This section explains how the design will ensure that the website is accessible.

## Activity 1

For the following project description, üü• define, üî∂ link, and üü¢ address the following implications:

- privacy
- intellectual property

### Project description

You are to create a website that allows Onslow College coaches to upload photographs of sporting events, tag the students, and post scores. This will allow students, whƒÅnau, and the wider community (including competing schools' coaches, students, etc.) to follow how the school is doing.

# Task

Identify **at least two** (2) relevant implications for your chosen website, its requirements, purpose, and end users. Then üü• define, üî∂ link, and üü¢ address them in your portfolio.
