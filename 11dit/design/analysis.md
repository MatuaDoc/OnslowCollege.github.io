# Research

As part of the design standard, you must **research** and generate a range of existing design ideas.

In the Research section of your portfolio, you will conduct research about how other websites are designed.

Your research should look at how various aspects of the website are made, including:

- your immediate impression of the website (good, bad, ugly, slick, etc.) and why
- what the main colours are, how they are used, how they make you feel
- how text has been laid out, including:
    - font size
    - colour
    - capitalisattion
    - fonts
    - contrast between fonts
- what information is presented on the home page versus another page (too much, too little, relevance)
- how media (images, graphics, video, audio) has been used
- how the navigation works (which pages are there, what do they contain)
- the general layout of the page, and how it helps communicate information

You should also consider:

- how the website keeps the user aware of the status of the system (what page or section they're on, etc.)
- how the Back button works when navigating between different parts of the website
- the choice of terminology used on the website
    - is it easy-to-understand? Jargon?
    - is it clear what the website wants you to do?
- the choice of icons used on the website, especially metaphors of abstract concepts
- places where the user could make a slip/mistake, and how the website prevents it

# How to conduct research

You must complete **at least three** (3) Plus-Minus-Interesting (PMI) charts. Each PMI chart is to be completed for one website each, meaning that you will examine **at least three** (3) websites.

## What websites to visit

Your research may be of sites that:

- have a similar **purpose**
- have a similar group of **end users**
- are related to the same topic
- are particularly well-designed

For each website, be sure to visit more than just the home page — examine any pages showing a lot of information, pages with a lot of pictures, etc.

## PMI charts

In the **Plus** box, write what you thought was good about the website:

- What did you like?
- What worked well?
- If it left a positive impression, what was it and why did you have?

In the **Minus** box, write about what you thought was **not** good about the website:

- What didn't you like?
- What didn't work well?
- If it left a negative imperssion, what was it and why?

In the **Interesting** box, you can record any other notes:

- What designs did you not find particularly good or bad?
- What things do you think you would copy from this website?

After the table, answer the question: **How might this site influence my design??** — Think of colours, fonts, layout, and how the website meets some of the usability heuristics.
