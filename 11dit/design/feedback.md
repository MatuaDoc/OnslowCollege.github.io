title: Feedback and Feedforward
---

We all know what it means to give your opinion on something — it's reporting how you feel about it. However, what you feel can be expressed as elaborately as

> "*I feel that the warmer hues portray a welcoming tone which ties in well with the purpose of the website, which is to attract new customers*"

as opposed to

> "*I like it.*"

There are two types of opinion you can give:

- feedback
- feedforward

# Feedback

**Feedback** is straight-forward. It is your reaction to something. In our case, we will gather feedback on the design of the website.

You will be used to receiving feedback from your teachers, and you might occasionally give it to your peers. "*That's really thoughtful writing*", "*Your shirt looks really cool*", or "*I don't like that outfit*".

When you give feedback, it's important that the designer can *use* it. What does it mean for feedback to be useful?

Useful feedback:

1. focuses on one thing at a time
2. is directed to the design, not the designer
3. links to the purpose and/or end users

## Focus on one thing at a time

When you give feedback, be sure to focus on what they are asking for. The designer is certain what they need to know about so make sure that your response is **focussed**.

For example: if a designer has asked you for feedback on a colour palette, give feedback about the colour palette. Try not to talk about other things, such as fonts, layout, graphics, etc.

> **Designer**: what do you think about this green in my palette?
> 
> **You**: I think it looks quite dark, especially with the other colours in your design being very bright.

This feedback is still focussed on the green — it incorporates a question about the other colours, but stays strictly about that particular green.

----

On the other hand, if a designer asks you for feedback on a font pairing, don't talk about colour palettes — **unless** your feedback is directly relevant to the font pairing.

> **Designer**: what do you think about using Times New Roman for the body font?

> **You**: I think it looks great! Very professional! Although, if you use that text colour, it could be a bit hard to read.

This feedback is still focussed on the font — it incorporates a question about colour, but still relates directly to the font.

This is especially true if you are providing negative feedback (about things you *don't* like) — imagine if the designer isn't sure about the fonts they chose, but you decide to list why you don't like the whole thing. That could be quite hurtful.

## Directed to the design, not the designer

When you give feedback, make sure you are talking about the **design**, not the **designer**. You are giving your feedback about the choices made in the design, not making a personal statement about the designer. Not everybody is a natural born designer — don't put people down.

For example:

| Design-directed | Design**er**-directed |
| :-- | :-- |
| I think that the dark grey font is hard to read against the green background | Can't you tell how hard the dark grey font is to read against the green background? Why did you pick such a weird combination? |

This helps spare the designer from hurt feelings. Even if they love their design, at least your feedback isn't directed towards them personally.

## Links to the purpose and/or end users

For any piece of feedback you give, make sure to explain **why** you give that feedback.

It's important the the designer knows why you think that way.

Specifically, every bit of feedback you give should relate to the **purpose and/or end users**.

Put yourself in the shoes of one of the design's end users: what could be important to you?

For example, if a website is meant to be vibrant and exciting in order to attract new customers, you could comment about how the design's relatively dim and dull colours don't make you feel interested in the product.

This relates to the **purpose**: the colour palette does not serve the purpose of attracting people.

----

Another example: if a website is intended for **all** users, then you could mention that the font pairings seem a bit hard to read, especially at smaller sizes, which could be an issue for people who have vision difficulties.

This relates to the **end users**: there is a specific issue with the design that could prevent the intended end users from being able to enjoy the website.

# Feedforward

**Feedforward** is like feedback, but it contains an extra element: in addition to providing your opinion, you also provide an example of a way by which you think the design can be improved.

For example:

> "_I think that the accent colour doesn't really pop out. It's a bit too similar to the base colour. **Have you tried using a complementary colour instead?**_"

This is especially useful when you're giving negative feedback. This allows the designer to better understand why you gave the feedback that you did, by seeing what you would have done instead.

When you give feedback, be sure to give feedforward for any elements you have a negative opinion about.

# Examples

## Feedback

> ✅ This is my favourite colour scheme. I like the way that the blue and yellow contrast. It's very eye-catching.

Great! I'll keep this colour palette. Thanks for the feedback!

> ✅ I think that the sans-serif body font and serif heading font pair well together. They look similar, but the serif heading is different enough to make it clear that it has its own job.

Awesome! I'll use these fonts then.

> ✅ These colours and fonts go really well together, but I know colourblind people might have a hard time.

Ah, I didn't think of that. Thanks, I'll run it through a colourblind checker.

> ⛔️ This colour palette sucks. What were you thinking?

… 😭

> ⛔️ I don't like that font, it looks old-fashioned and dumb.

OK, and? 😡

## Feedforward

> ✅ The blue and grey look a bit similar to me. Have you tried making the grey a bit lighter so that they contrast more?

No, I haven't tried that, but I think it might work. I'll give it a go and ask for more feedback later!

> ✅ I love this green, but I don't think it makes the best heading font colour. Have you thought of using it as an accent colour instead?

I did, actually! Let me show you what that looked like …

> ✅ This font looks pretty cool at large sizes but hard to read when it's small. I could be wrong, but I think the issue is the background colour. I think a contrast check might help.

Great idea, I haven't done one yet. Let me get right on it!

> ⛔️ That red is really hard to read. I don't like it. Change it.

… change it to what? 🤔

> ⛔️ I don't like the handwriting font.

Well, I wish you'd said what kind of font you *do* like. 🙄
