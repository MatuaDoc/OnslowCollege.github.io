title: Design & Digital Media
preamble: |
  In Design & Digital Media, you will work on a project to design and develop a website. This unit will be assessed with three standards:

    * Internal assessments (7 credits)
        * [**AS91878**: Develop a design for a digital outcome](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91878.pdf) (3 credits)
        * [**AS91880**: Develop a digital media outcome](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91880.pdf) (4 credits)
    * External assessments (3 credits)
        * [**AS91886**: Demonstrate understanding of human computer interaction](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91886.pdf) (3 credits)

  The design component requires you to produce a lot of documentation. It is important that you keep all of the work that you do for this unit together. Please make sure that **OneDrive** is installed on your computer, running, and connected to your Onslow College account.

  > If you lose access to your work because you saved it on a school computer and did not save it to OneDrive, **YOU WILL NOT BE GIVEN AN EXTENSION**!
