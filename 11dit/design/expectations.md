title: Meeting user expectations
---

In technology, design refers to both **aesthetics** (how something looks) and **functionality** (how something works). You can't have one without the other.

In 1994, Jakob Nielsen came up with ten general principles for interaction design — how people **use** a technological outcome — called [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

These are:

1. Visibilty of system status
2. **Match between system and the real world**
3. User control and freedom
4. **Consistency and standards**
5. Error prevention
6. **Recognition rather than recall**
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

This page is concerned with heuristics 2, 4, and 6.
