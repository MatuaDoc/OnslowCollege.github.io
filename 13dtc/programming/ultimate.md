# Task

## Scenario

One final task before the practice assessment…

- Create a program that stores information on all of your classes for the week.
- You should be able to select a day of the week, and it will list your classes.
- You should be able to select a class, and it will list:
    - the full name of the course
    - the teacher's code
    - the teacher's full name (i.e. Miss Voropaeva/Whaea Tina)
    - the times the class starts and ends

To save time, just create the same classes for every day of the week — then just change one class per day to make them different.

**If you have time**, use your actual, full timetable.

## Requirements

- You must use object-oriented techniques (create classes and objects)
- You must create a GUI

## Extension

Instead of selecting a day of the week using a combo box or list widget, use a ``QCalendarWidget``.
