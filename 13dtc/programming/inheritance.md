Inheritance

**Inheritance** works very similarly to using [protocols](04.protocols.md).

Just as classes *conform* to protocols, classes can also *inherit* from other classes — however, this means getting not just the original class' methods but also its members.

## Base classes, superclasses, subclasses

As the name implies, inheritance works by a hierarchy: something receives the data and methods from something else, and it might pass that data and methods on to yet another thing.

In this hierarchy, consider three levels:

- Base classes
- Superclasses
- Subclasses

## Base classes

A base class in Python is one which does not inherit from any other class (technically, all classes inherit from a class called Object — but that isn't important).

**In all the previous lessons, we created base classes.**

Take this base class defining the features of a building: the street number and street name.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Building:
    _street_number: int
    _street_name: str

    @property
    def address(self) -> str:
        return f"{self._street_number} {self._street_name}"
```

## Superclasses and subclasses

Of course, different types of buildings need different kinds of information. We can create **subclasses** that inherit from the ``Building`` class. For each of these subclasses, ``Building`` will be the **superclass**.

To declare a subclass, you specify the superclass in brackets directly after the name of the class, like so:

```python
class MySubclass(Superclass):
```

You can also override a superclass' function with a new implementation, similar to conforming to a protocol. Just write the new implementation using the same function name.

For example, let's create an a ``House`` and an ``Apartment`` class.

```python
@dataclass
class House(Building):
    _street_letter: str

    # Overriding the original address property's behaviour
    @property
    def address(self):
        return f"{self._street_letter}{self._street_number} {self._street_name}"
```

You can also use the superclass' version of the function within the subclass, even as part of overriding it. In the following example, we use the original superclass' ``address`` property as part of the apartment address.

```python
@dataclass
class Apartment(Building):
    _suite_number: int
    _suite_letter: str

    @property
    def address(self) -> str:
        return f"Suite {self._suite_number}{self._suite_letter}\n{super().address}"
```

## Creating subclass objects

Subclasses are turned into objects in the exact same way as the base classes we've made before.

For example, the following works:

```python
building = Building(42, "Wallaby Way")
house = House(742, "Evergreen Terrace", "A")
apartment = Apartment(495, "Grove Street", 20, "")

print(building.address)  # 42 Wallaby Way

print(house.address)     # 742A Evergreen Terrace

print(apartment.address) # Suite 20
                         # 495 Grove Street
```
