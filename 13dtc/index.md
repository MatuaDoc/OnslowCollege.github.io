# Learning objectives
## Develop a computer program

- writing code that performs a specified task
- using [complex techniques](#programming-techniques) in a suitable programming language
    - in this course, we will be teaching Python 3.10 and higher
    - you may use another language by negotiation with the teacher; however, you are responible for ensuring that it is suitable for the task and meets the requirements of the relevant assessments
- setting out program code clearly
- documenting the code with appropriate variable and module names and comments that describe code function and behaviour
- comprehensively testing and debugging the program to ensure that it works on a sample of expected cases, relevant boundary cases, and invalid cases
- ensuring that the program is a well-structured, logical response to the specified task
- making the program flexible and reliable

## Use complex processes to develop a digital technologies outcome

- using [appropriate project management tools and techniques](#project-management-tools-and-techniques) to plan the development of a digital technologies outcome
- decomposing the outcome into smaller components
- trialling, testing, and improving
    - trialling the components of the digital technologies outcome (presenting different options, gathering feedback, making changes based on feedback)
    - testing that the digital technologies outcome functions as intended
    - using information appropriately from trialling and testing to improve the functionality of the digital technologies outcome
- explaining and addressing relevant implications

# Complex tools and techniques

## Programming techniques

Complex programming techniques include:

1. programming or writing code for a graphical user interface (GUI)
2. reading from, or writing to, files or other persistent storage
3. object-oriented programming using class(es) and objects that you define
4. using types that you define
5. using third-party or non-core APIs, libraries, or frameworks
6. using complex data structures
  - e.g. stacks, queues, trees and nodes, etc.

In 13DTC, you will learn to do all of these. However, only two complex techniques are required to pass.

In class, you will use Python 3.10 (or higher) including some of its newer features like [structural pattern matching](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/), [3.5's type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0483/), and [union types](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0604/).

You will also learn to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/). You will present your documentation on GitHub via [GitHub-Flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) documents *(you're actually reading one right now!)*.

## Project management tools and techniques

- agile or waterfall techniques
- kanban or scrum boards
- version control software
- collaboration tools
- managing assets

In 12DTC, you will learn to use [Microsoft Planner](https://tasks.office.com/onslow.school.nz/en-NZ/Home/Planner/), part of the Office 365 suite. This tool contains features to plan tasks in a manner similar to a kanban board, suitable for agile development, and offers collaboration tools if you plan to work on a group project.

You will also use Git to perform version control of your code and documentation.
