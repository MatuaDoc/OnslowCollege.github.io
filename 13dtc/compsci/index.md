  # Standard

  - [**AS91908**: Analyse an area of computer science](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91908.pdf)

  Candidates will be required to respond in short and/or extended answers (800–1500 words in total) to questions relating to their choice of ONE of the following areas of computer science:

  - formal languages
  - computer vision
  - ~~computer graphics~~ (not taught at Onslow College in 2022)
      - if you would like to learn about computer graphics, check out [Computer Graphics on the Computer Science Field Guide](https://www.csfieldguide.org.nz/en/chapters/computer-graphics/)

  Resources (case studies and/or other information) will be provided, and the questions will refer to these. Candidates may use words, numerical workings, and diagrams in their responses to show their reasoning.

  ## Achievement levels

  - **Achieved**: analyse an area of computer science involves giving an explanation of:
      - the key aspects of the computer science area
      - relevant algorithms or other mechanisms behind the area
      - how the area is used, is implemented, or occurs, giving examples
  - **Merit**: analyse, in depth, an area of computer science involves:
      - providing a detailed explanation of how the technical capabilities and limitations of the area relate to humans, giving examples
      - comparing and contrasting different perspectives on the area
  - **Excellence**: critically analyse an area of computer science involves drawing insightful conclusions about the computer science area
      - *Examples of insightful conclusions include:*
          - innovative and imaginative connections
          - exploration of less obvious implications
          - making justified predictions
          - suggesting improvements
          - making justified generalisations that could be applied beyond the area itself
          - use of higher level thinking skills such as synthesis
