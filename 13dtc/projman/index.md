  In Complex Processes, you will work on a project to design and develop a program. This unit will be assessed based on the following standard:
  
  * Internal assessments (6 credits)
      * [**AS91907**: Use complex processes to develop a digital technologies outcome](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91907.pdf) (6 credits)
  
  The standard requires you to produce a lot of documentation. It is important that you keep all of the work that you do for this unit together. Please make sure that **OneDrive** is installed on your computer, running, and connected to your Onslow College account.

  > If you lose access to your work because you saved it on a school computer and did not save it to OneDrive, **YOU WILL NOT BE GIVEN AN EXTENSION**!
