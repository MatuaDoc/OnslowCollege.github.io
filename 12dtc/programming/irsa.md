# Task

## Scenario

Your early start to university is going great until eventually, due to various circumstances, you are forced to move to online-only learning.

Except, not on the internet.

Over **nautical radio**.

Why? … Because! That's why.

## Requirements

1. Create a program that allows you to communicate via telegraph machine by converting text to the IRSA
2. You will be provided with sample text in the assignment. The results will be provided in tests
  - Make sure that your program converts the sample text to IRSA words correctly by ensuring that the tests pass

Feel free to print the IRSA words as you develop it in order to test that your code is working properly.

# NATO alphabet

The [International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet) is a communication method where letters and numbers are converted to words. This makes them easier to understand over poor radio connections, such as when out at sea.

## Representation

To represent these on a computer, you will substitute the characters with the IRSA terms surrounded by a space. Ignore spaces and punctuation.

For example:

- the letter Y: ``yankee``
- the words "onslow college.":
  - ``oscar november sierra lima oscar whiskey charlie oscar lima lima echo golf echo STOP``
