| [AS91896](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91896.pdf) | Use advanced programming techniques to develop a computer program | 2 | Internal | 6 |

# Explanation from the standard

| Achievement | Achievement with Merit | Achievement with Excellence |
| :-- | :-: | --: |
| Use advanced programming techniques to develop a computer program | Use advanced programming techniques to develop an informed computer program | Use advanced programming techniques to develop a refined computer program |

An advanced computer program:

- uses variables storing at least two types of data (e.g. numeric, text, Boolean)
- uses sequence, selection and iteration control structures
- takes input from a user, sensors, or other external source
- produces output
- uses two or more advanced programming techniques.

Examples of **advanced programming techniques** include:

- modifying data stored in collections (e.g. lists, arrays, dicionaries)
- storing multidimensional data in collections
- creating methods, functions, or procedures that use parameters an- or return values
- responding to events generated by a graphical user interface (GUI)
- using non-trivial string manipulation
- using additional non-core libraries.

# Time allowance

You will have until the end of Term 2 Week 3 to complete this task.

There will be **NO** extensions.

# Task

You have been employed at a local farm's egg shop.

You must create a program that will keep track of the egg inventory, including adding stock, dividing the stock into cartons and trays, and selling eggs to customers.

Your program will let you:

1. add a number of eggs to the stock
    - this includes the size of the egg (4 to 8)
2. manually change the number of eggs (for a given size) in stock
3. list how many cartons/trays are available in stock
    - cartons of six (6)
    - cartons of twelve (12)
    - trays of twenty-four (24)
4. sell cartons/trays to customers with the following prices
    - size 4 egg: $0.22 each
    - size 5 egg: $0.26 each
    - size 6 egg: $0.32 each
    - size 7 egg: $0.40 each
    - size 8 egg: $0.44 each
5. when selling eggs, offer a discount
    - cartons of six (6) include a 5% discount
    - cartons of twelve (12) include an 10% discount
    - tray of twenty-four (24) include a 20% discount
6. keep receipts for all sales, including what was sold

# Assessment Requirements

## Achieved

For Achieved, you must:

- store data in at least **two** (2) types (text, number, boolean, etc.)
- use conditional statements and/or loops
- get input from the user
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with expected cases

You must also use at least **two** (2) of the following advanced techniques:

- modify data stored in at least **two** (2) collections (lists or dictionaries)
- store multidimensional data in collections, including:
  - lists of lists (2D lists)
  - lists of dictionaries
  - dictionaries with lists as the value
  - dictionaries with dictionaries as the value)
- create at least **two** (2) functions that use parameters and/or return values
- use non-trivial string manipulation
- use additional non-core libraries

## Achieved with Merit

For Achieved with Merit, you must:

- follow conventions from the programming language
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with both expected cases and relevant boundary cases

## Achieved with Excellence

For Achieved with Excellence, you must:

- ensure that your program is flexible and robust
  - it should reduce repeated code througout your program
  - it should use constants appropriately
  - it must behave in an expected manner
  - it must not crash
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with expected and boundary cases, and correctly handles invalid cases


# Restrictions

You must:
- use a suitable, text-based programming language
  - You will be expected to use Python unless you have consulted with your teacher

You may:
- consult this website's notes
- consult your previous work
- consult with other students for advice and ideas

However, you may **not**:
- copy other students' work, even with modifications
- copy code online without proper attribution
- ask other students to fix errors for you
- present any content you did not create as your own work
