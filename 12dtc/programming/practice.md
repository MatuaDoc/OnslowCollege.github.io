# Explanation from the standard

| Achievement | Achievement with Merit | Achievement with Excellence |
| :-- | :-: | --: |
| Use advanced programming techniques to develop a computer program | Use advanced programming techniques to develop an informed computer program | Use advanced programming techniques to develop a refined computer program |

An advanced computer program:

- uses variables storing at least two types of data (e.g. numeric, text, Boolean)
- uses sequence, selection and iteration control structures
- takes input from a user, sensors, or other external source
- produces output
- uses two or more advanced programming techniques.

Examples of **advanced programming techniques** include:

- modifying data stored in collections (e.g. lists, arrays, dicionaries)
- storing multidimensional data in collections
- creating methods, functions, or procedures that use parameters an- or return values
- responding to events generated by a graphical user interface (GUI)
- using non-trivial string manipulation
- using additional non-core libraries.

# Time allowance

You will have until the end of Term 1 to complete this task.

There will be **NO** extensions.

# Task

You have found recent employment at a movie streaming service called **Onsflix**.

You must create a program that will keep track of all the movies on the system. It will allow you to keep track of all the movies, along with how long each one lasts.

Although in the real world this would be automatic, you will supply the data manually using your program.

Your program will let you:

1. record the name and running time of a movie in minutes
2. delete a movie from your records
3. edit the length of a stored movie
4. display the running time of a given movie in hours and minutes in the format ``HH:MM``
5. list all the movie names (in alphabetical order) along with their running times in the format ``HH:MM``

# Assessment Requirements

## Achieved

For Achieved, you must:

- store data in at least **two** (2) types (text, number, boolean, etc.)
- use conditional statements and/or loops
- get input from the user
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with expected cases

You must also use at least **two** (2) of the following advanced techniques:

- modify data stored in at least **two** (2) collections (lists or dictionaries)
- store multidimensional data in collections, including:
  - lists of lists (2D lists)
  - lists of dictionaries
  - dictionaries with lists as the value
  - dictionaries with dictionaries as the value)
- create at least **two** (2) functions that use parameters and/or return values
- use non-trivial string manipulation
- use additional non-core libraries

## Achieved with Merit

For Achieved with Merit, you must:

- follow conventions from the programming language
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with both expected cases and relevant boundary cases

## Achieved with Excellence

For Achieved with Excellence, you must:

- ensure that your program is flexible and robust
  - it should reduce repeated code througout your program
  - it should use constants appropriately
  - it must behave in an expected manner
  - it must not crash
- test your program, in an organised way, to ensure the program works with expected and boundary cases, and correctly handles invalid cases


# Restrictions

You must:
- use a suitable, text-based programming language
  - You will be expected to use Python unless you have consulted with your teacher

You may:
- consult this website's notes
- consult your previous work
- consult with other students for advice and ideas

However, you may **not**:
- copy other students' work, even with modifications
- copy code online without proper attribution
- ask other students to fix errors for you
- present any content as your own work

# Submission
