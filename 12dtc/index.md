# Learning objectives
## Develop a computer program

- writing code that performs a specified task
- using [advanced techniques](#programming-techniques) in a suitable programming language
    - in this course, we will be teaching Python 3.10 and higher
    - you may use another language by negotiation with the teacher; however, you are responible for ensuring that it is suitable for the task and meets the requirements of the relevant assessments
- setting out program code clearly
- documenting the code with appropriate variable and module names and comments that describe code function and behaviour
- following common conventions for the chosen programming language (PEP-8)
- comprehensively testing and debugging the program to ensure that it works on a sample of expected cases, relevant boundary cases, and handles invalid cases
- ensuring that the program is a well-structured, logical response to the specified task
- making the program flexible and reliable

## Use advanced processes to develop a digital technologies outcome

- using [appropriate project management tools and techniques](#project-management-tools-and-techniques) to plan the development of a digital technologies outcome
- decomposing the outcome into smaller components
- trialling, testing, and improving
    - trialling the components of the digital technologies outcome (presenting different options, gathering feedback, making changes based on feedback)
    - testing that the digital technologies outcome functions as intended
    - using information appropriately from trialling and testing to improve the functionality of the digital technologies outcome
- explaining and addressing relevant implications

## Use advanced techniques to develop a database

- designing, organising, and querying the data logically
- using appropriate tools and [advanced techniques](#database-techniques) to organise, query, and present data for a purpose and end users
- trialling, testing, and improving
  - applying appropriate data integrity and testing procedures
  - using information from testing procedures to improve the quality of the database
- explaining and addressing relevant implications
- iterative improvement throughout the design, development, and testing process
- presenting the data effectively for the purpose and end users

# Advanced tools and techniques

## Programming techniques

Advanced programming techniques include:

1. Modifying data stored in collections (i.e. lists, dictionaries)
2. Storing multi-dimensional data in collections
3. Creating functions that use parameters and/or return values
4. Responding to events generated by a graphical user interface (GUI)
5. Using non-trivial string manipulation
6. Using additional non-core libraries

In 12DTC, you will learn to do most of these. However, only two complex techniques are required to pass.

In class, you will use Python 3.10 (or higher) including some of its newer features like [structural pattern matching](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/), [3.5's type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0483/), and [union types](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0604/).

You will also learn to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/). You will present your documentation on GitHub via [GitHub-Flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) documents *(you're actually reading one right now!)*.

## Project management tools and techniques

- agile or waterfall techniques
- kanban or scrum boards
- version control software
- collaboration tools
- managing assets

In 12DTC, you will learn to use GitHub Planner. This tool contains features to plan tasks in a manner similar to a kanban board, suitable for agile development, and offers collaboration tools if you plan to work on a group project.

You will also use Git to perform version control of your code and documentation.

## Database techniques

- linking data in related tables or nodes using queries or keys
- writing custom queries to filter and/or sort data
- using logical, mathematical, and/or wildcard operators
- customising presentation of the data
- using custom forms to add user input to the database
- setting validation rules for data entry
