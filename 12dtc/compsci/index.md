  In Computer Science, you will work on a project to design and develop a program. This unit will be assessed based on the following standard:
  
  * External assessment (3 credits)
      * [**AS91898**: Demonstrate understanding of a computer science concept](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91898.pdf) (3 credits)
  
  The standard is assessed externally during the Digital Common Assessment Task (DCAT) scheduled for Term 4. You will answer questions exam-style in a Word document then submit a PDF document. This PDF document will be sent to NZQA for external marking by other teachers around the country.

  There will be a practice exam in Term 3 Week 10. This is to familiarise you with the format of the DCAT exam.
