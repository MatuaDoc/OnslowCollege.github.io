{% include half.html html=left_html right_markdown="Computer security, also known as cybersecurity or IT security, is the protection of information systems from theft or damage to the hardware, the software, and to the information on them, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide." %}

It includes controlling physical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access, data and code injection, and due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional, accidental, or due to them being tricked into deviating from secure procedures.

## Why is computer security important?

{% include shout.html emote="üè¶" side="right" markdown="Prevention of data theft such as bank account numbers, credit card information, passwords, work related documents or sheets, etc. is essential in today‚Äôs communications since many of our day to day actions depend on the security of the data paths." %}

Data present in a computer can also be misused by unauthorized intrusions. An intruder can modify and change the program source codes and can also use your pictures or email accounts to create derogatory content such as fake misleading and offensive social accounts.

{% include shout.html emote="ü¶πüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" side="left" markdown="While the Internet has transformed and greatly improved our lives, this vast network and its associated technologies have opened the door to an increasing number of security threats from which individuals, families and business must protect themselves." %}

The consequences of attacks can range from the mildly inconvenient to the completely debilitating. Important data can be lost, privacy can be violated and your computer can even used by an outside attacker to attack other computers on the Internet.

Therefore, it is necessary to protect your computer and hence the need for Computer Security arises.

# Main areas

Computer Security is concerned with these main areas:

1. Confidentiality: only authorized users can access the data resources and information
2. Integrity: only authorized users should be able to modify the data when needed
3. Availability: data should be available to users when needed
4. Privacy: information will be used only in ways known to the person providing it
5. Authentication: are you really communicating with whom you think you are communicating?
6. Authorisation: only authorised users have access to the information
7. Accountability: every activity can be attributed to a known person

# Task

Let's start the topic with a bit of research. You may work in groups to research these answers, but you should submit your own responses. Find out:

1. in which decade was computer security introduced?
2. why was computer security needed at the time?
3. why is computer security needed today?
4. what consumer products (intended for regular people, not organisations) exist to protect peoples' computer security?
  - list the names of at least 3 different products that protect against different kinds of attacks
  - against what kinds of attacks do they protect? List at least 3
