{% include half.html html=left_html right_markdown="Computer security, also known as cybersecurity or IT security, is the protection of information systems from theft or damage to the hardware, the software, and to the information on them, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide." %}

It includes controlling physical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access, data and code injection, and due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional, accidental, or due to them being tricked into deviating from secure procedures.

## Why is computer security important?

{% include shout.html emote="üè¶" side="right" markdown="Prevention of data theft such as bank account numbers, credit card information, passwords, work related documents or sheets, etc. is essential in today‚Äôs communications since many of our day to day actions depend on the security of the data paths." %}

Data present in a computer can also be misused by unauthorized intrusions. An intruder can modify and change the program source codes and can also use your pictures or email accounts to create derogatory content such as fake misleading and offensive social accounts.

{% include shout.html emote="ü¶πüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" side="left" markdown="While the Internet has transformed and greatly improved our lives, this vast network and its associated technologies have opened the door to an increasing number of security threats from which individuals, families and business must protect themselves." %}

The consequences of attacks can range from the mildly inconvenient to the completely debilitating. Important data can be lost, privacy can be violated and your computer can even used by an outside attacker to attack other computers on the Internet.

Therefore, it is necessary to protect your computer and hence the need for Computer Security arises.
