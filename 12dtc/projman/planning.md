title: Planning and process checklist
---

# Beginning

1. Review/analyse existing planning tools to inform the planning tools you have selected. You can do this through an existing project or your own research. Mindtools.com has a number of useful articles (or see the next page).
2. Use your planning tools to:
	a. Set achievable goals
	b. Establish required resources (for planning and development eg: time, software, hardware)
	c. Determine critical review points at key stages of your practice, such as:
		i. On the completion of research, and/or
		ii. Having gained feedback of your design ideas
	d. Provide evidence of how you are reviewing your progress and any revisions you are making to your planning to ensure you complete the outcome.
3. Decide on an appropriate planning methodology and what project management (AGILE!) and version control tools (Github!) you will use to manage your program development 
4. Explain what relevant implications are important to consider in the development of your program.
	a. Why is this relevant implication important in regards to your program?
5. Decompose your program into the different components you need to incorporate into the final program.
 
# Development
 
During development, probably at each review point, you will need to ensure you have provided evidence of how you:

6. Trialled multiple components. For example, this could include different ways to present the user interface. You should also think about the advanced programming techniques that will best make your program flexible and robust. Select the best components and/or advanced programming techniques to include in your final program, based on the results of your testing and trialling.
7. Demonstrated how testing and trialling has improved the functionality of your program. This could be through feedback. Improvements can be bug fixes.
8. Use your selected version control tools/techniques to save successive versions of your code and keep evidence of how you created the program in an ongoing manner (e.g. a screenshot of your successive Github commits)
9. Revised and /or confirmed your goals and the resources and planning tools you are using in order to complete your outcome
10. Optimised your use of time and materials
 
# Evaluation
 
11. Discuss how the information from planning, testing and trialling of the components of your program assisted you to develop a high-quality outcome.
	a. Show how feedback from users and the testing process helped to refine the program.
	b. Show planning tools with reflection on how it guided the development process and helped to complete all the components and keep on track with time management
12. Show how your program has addressed the relevant implications
	a. Provide evidence of how you have addressed the relevant implications as you stated you would at the beginning of the project.
