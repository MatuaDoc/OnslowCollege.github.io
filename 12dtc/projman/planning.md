# Project management

Project management is about how you organise yourself and your time throughout your project. In industry, projects tend to be a lot more complex than they are at school, and project management is vital. There are many ways of managing projects — a very popular system in the software industry today is **agile development**. 

If you have already decomposed your project and planned your time, you have done a large part of the project management already. The next part is organising yourself while you work. Some common techniques are described below.

# Methodologies

## Agile development

Agile development arose as a result of the fast-paced software development environment and a need for businesses to move quickly and efficiently.

The big ideas are:

- following dynamic process that adapts quickly to changing requirements
- following an **iterative** development cycle with **incremental** delivery of components rather than trying to deliver right at the end
- work in self-managing teams with involved stakeholders where everybody works towards one goal
- incorporate continual feedback, improvement, planning, and learning

## Waterfall methodology

A more traditional style of development is the waterfall, where each step trickles down to the next — but never returns back to the previous step. Waterfalls go down, not up — it's a one way trip.

Compare the sequence of steps in the traditional waterfall methodology to agile:

| Waterfall | Agile |
| :-: | :-: |
| ![Waterfall](img/planning_waterfall.png) | ![Agile](img/planning_agile.png) |

This means that the process is set out at the start of a project and never modified. If the project requirements ever change, the waterfall methodology cannot deal with this — accounting for any changes will have to wait until the whole process starts over again, meaning that the deployed product will *definitely* not meet those new requirements.

# Scrum

Scrum is a framework, or a set of processes, that can be followed to **manage** a profile in an angile manner. It is named after a rugby scram, emphasising the need for a team to work together towards a common goal.

![Scrum](img/planning_scrum.jpg)

In many businesses, a strict scrum framework is followed, but in others the model is adjusted to suit the team and the project.

In a school setting, you could use the following parts of the scrum framework to help you work in a more agile manner.

## Product backlog

This is a list of tasks required to complete a project. You would select a few tasks from this list to work on at a time, rather than trying to work on everything at once.

> For example, think about the Onsflix program. You could decompose the project down to (1) adding movies (2) editing movie run times (3) deleting movies, and (4) listing movies — each of these would exist in the product backlog.

## Working in sprints

In agile and scrum, work is divided up into short sessions called **sprints**.

In industry a sprint usually has a duration of 2 weeks. At the start of the sprint the team selects a small list of tasks or features from the product backlog, and focuses on completing these tasks by the end of the sprint

This iterative process means that the product is being improved and tested regularly in short cycles, rather than only at the end.

One benefit of sprints is that at any time the team is working on a  limited number of tasks, making them more focussed and efficient. Although the main planning meetings happen at the beginning and end of each sprint, quick daily meetings called ‘stand-up’ or scrum meetings are also held.

## Daily scrums

Daily scrums are a way of checking in quickly each day to share progress with other members of the team and to move tasks across the project board. The development team huddles together to focus on:

- progress being made towards the sprint goal
- what is blocking progress

These are also called 'stand-up meetings'. The ‘stand-up’ aspect of these meetings is designed to keep them **short**! There should be no discussion or updating of the [project board](#project-boards); that can be done later after the scrum is over.

If you are working alone on your outcome development project, instead of a meeting you could set 5 minutes aside to update your planning and review your tasks every day before you start working on your code.

## Retrospective

At the end of each sprint is a good time to reflect and talk with others in the team about what co-operative strategies worked well and what could be improved for the next sprint.

It’s also a good time to update your planning. This is when you would:

- complete any testing and trialling before starting the next sprint
- based on the testing and trialling, refine your backlog (strip out any unnecessary components, add in others that were determined during your sprint)
- determine what components need to be worked on next

## Project boards

Project boards are methods of displaying the tasks you need to do. They are also called kanban boards (from the Japanese 看板, meaning 'signboard').

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jf0tlbt9lx0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This visual method of displaying the status of tasks is usually a table (whiteboard, paper, online) divided into columns, with a way of moving tasks between the columns (sticky notes, text boxes, online notes).

Having a visual planner such as a project board helps everyone on the team easily see what is going on, encouraging focus and teamwork. A project board is equally useful if you are working alone on your project.

### Columns and limits

A simple version uses columns such as:

- Backlog
- In-Progress
- QA (or Testing)
- Complete

For each column, specify a maximum number of components. For example, you could state that in a single sprint, you should work on no more than two components at a time.

Defining a limit like this prevents you from overloading your plate and making your sprint unmanageable.

| Backlog | In-Progress (2) | QA (2) | Complete |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |

### How to build a project board

| Tool | | Description |
| :-- | :-: | :-- |
| Whiteboard | ![Whiteboard](img/planning_whiteboard.png) | If you have a safe space in the classroom, you could use sticky notes and a whiteboard to organise your project. Having it public will keep it forefront in your mind! |
| Online | ![Online](img/planning_online.png) | There are many online tools such as [Microsoft Planner](https://planner.office.com/), [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/creating-a-project-board), [Trello](https://trello.com), [Padlet](https://padlet.com) |

Here's a tutorial video for Microsoft Planner, which comes free with your Microsoft 365 subscription provided by the school:

Here's a tutorial video on how to create a project board with GitHub Projects, which you can associate with a GitHub repository that you create:

### Game

Try the [Kanban Board Game](http://www.kanbanboardgame.com).

You will manage members of a team by assigning them to components on a project board. Each component requires a certain amount of analysis, development, and testing. How much money can you make for the company with good project management?

# Reminders 

Once you get moving on your project you may find it hard to remember to pause and reflect. No matter what system you choose for managing your project, you need to ensure you build in regular points at which you do the following:  

- updates to your planning
    - if you are working in sprints, the last task in each sprint might be to check milestones and update planning. 
- testing and trialling of components
    - if you are using a Trello type of tool, the last task on each checklist might be ‘test’. 
- review relevant implications
    - in your evidence for this assessment you need to explain some wider implications that are relevant to your outcome, and show how you addressed these. It is easier to do this as you go, so you should build reminders into your planning system. 
- collect evidence for your assessment
    - you need to gather evidence showing that you used a selection of appropriate project management tools and techniques. Set up reminders for yourself — at the end of each sprint or at each milestone might be appropriate places to take a screenshot showing the current version of your project board and paste it into your evidence document.
